	abstract     = {Abstract Particle filters are ensemble-based assimilation schemes that, unlike the ensemble Kalman filter, employ a fully nonlinear and non-{G}aussian analysis step to compute the probability distribution function (pdf) of a systems state conditioned on a set of observations. Evidence is provided that the ensemble size required for a successful particle filter scales exponentially with the problem size. For the simple example in which each component of the state vector is independent, {G}aussian, and of unit variance and the observations are of each state component separately with independent, {G}aussian errors, simulations indicate that the required ensemble size scales exponentially with the state dimension. In this example, the particle filter requires at least 1011 members when applied to a 200-dimensional state. Asymptotic results, following the work of Bengtsson, Bickel, and collaborators, are provided for two cases: one in which each prior state component is independent and identically distributed, and one in which both the prior pdf and the observation errors are {G}aussian. The asymptotic theory reveals that, in both cases, the required ensemble size scales exponentially with the variance of the observation log likelihood rather than with the state dimension per se.}
